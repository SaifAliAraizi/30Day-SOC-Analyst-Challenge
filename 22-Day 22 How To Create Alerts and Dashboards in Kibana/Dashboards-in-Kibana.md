## Day 22 ‚Äì Alert and Dashboard Setup (Araizii SOC Analyst Challenge)

Welcome to **Day 22** of the *30-Day Araizii SOC Analyst Challenge*, a challenge designed to help aspiring SOC analysts gain practical experience in 30 days.

If you haven‚Äôt followed along yet, it‚Äôs recommended to start from **Day 1**.  
By the end of this day, you‚Äôll have:
- An **alert** that detects Mythic C2 activity (generated on Day 21)
- A **dashboard** to visualize suspicious activity

---

### üß† Objective
Detect and visualize Mythic C2 activity (Apollo agent) using Elastic Stack.

---

### üß© Step 1: Investigating Mythic C2 in Discover

1. Navigate to **Discover** in Elastic.
2. Set time range to **Last 30 days**.
3. Search for:
   ```
   servicehostdsten.exe
   ```
4. Sort results from **Old ‚Üí New** to see initial activity.
5. Identify the **file creation event**:
   - **Event Code:** 11 (Sysmon File Created)
   - **Path:** `C:\Users\Public\Downloads\`
   - **Username:** Administrator
   - **Image:** PowerShell
   - **ProcessGuid:** (used for correlation)

6. Change query to find process creation:
   ```
   event.code:1
   ```
   This will show **process creation (Sysmon Event ID 1)** including hashes.

7. Copy the **SHA1** or **SHA256 hash** and check it on **VirusTotal** (likely undetected as it‚Äôs a newly generated Mythic agent).

8. Observe the field:
   ```
   winlog.event_data.OriginalFileName: apollo.exe
   ```
   This is the real executable name before being renamed.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Building a Detection Query

1. Query for both conditions:
   ```kql
   (winlog.event_data.hashes:*<SHA256_hash>* OR winlog.event_data.OriginalFileName:apollo.exe) AND event.code:1
   ```
2. Verify only one event appears.
3. Save this search as:
   ```
   Mythic Apollo Process Create
   ```

---

### üö® Step 3: Creating the Detection Rule

1. Go to **Security ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Create new rule**.
2. Select **Custom Query** type.
3. Paste in your saved query.
4. Add **Required Fields**:
   - `@timestamp`
   - `winlog.event_data.User`
   - `winlog.event_data.ParentImage`
   - `winlog.event_data.ParentCommandLine`
   - `winlog.event_data.Image`
   - `winlog.event_data.CommandLine`
   - `winlog.event_data.ProcessGuid`
   - `winlog.event_data.CurrentDirectory`
5. Configure:
   - **Rule Name:** `Araizii - Mythic C2 Apollo Agent Detected`
   - **Description:** Detects potential Mythic C2 Apollo agent activity.
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Schedule:** Every 5 minutes (lookback: 5 minutes)
6. Click **Create & Enable Rule**.

   ```

### üìä Step 4: Creating a Suspicious Activity Dashboard

We‚Äôll visualize:
1. **Process Creation Events** (Event ID 1)
2. **External Network Connections** (Event ID 3)
3. **Windows Defender Disabled** (Event ID 50001)

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Powershell / CMD / rundll32 Executions
Query:
```kql
event.code:1 AND event.provider:"Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" AND (powershell OR cmd OR rundll32)
```
Create a **Table Visualization** with columns:
- User
- Parent Image
- Parent Command Line
- Image
- Command Line
- Current Directory

Title it:
```
Process Created (PowerShell, CMD, rundll32)
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ External Network Connections
Query:
```kql
event.code:3 AND event.provider:"Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" AND winlog.event_data.Initiated:true
```
Table fields:
- Image
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Destination Port

Exclude:
```kql
NOT winlog.event_data.Image:msmpeng.exe
```
Title:
```
Process Initiated Network Connections
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Defender Disabled
Query:
```kql
event.code:50001 AND event.provider:"Microsoft-Defender"
```
Table fields:
- Host Name
- Product Name
- Event Code

Title:
```
Microsoft Defender Disabled
```

### üßæ Step 5: Dashboard Overview

![Kibana Dashboard](../images/22-kibana-alert-and-dashboard2.png)

You now have a 3-panel dashboard:
| Panel | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Process Created** | Detects suspicious PowerShell, CMD, or rundll32 executions |
| **Network Connections** | Shows outbound connections initiated by processes |
| **Defender Disabled** | Detects when Microsoft Defender is turned off |
   ```
---

### ‚úÖ Summary

By completing Day 22, you have:
- Built an **Elastic Detection Rule** for Mythic C2 (Apollo agent)
- Created a **Dashboard** for quick visibility into suspicious activities
- Practiced **event correlation and alert logic** for real-world SOC workflows
