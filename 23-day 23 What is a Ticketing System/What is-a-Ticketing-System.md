## üéØ What is a Ticketing System?

When an **alert** is triggered in any of your security tools, it‚Äôs important to **track** these alerts to identify potential signs of:

- Misconfigurations
- Attacks
- Or understand what actions were taken in response

A **ticketing system** provides a structured way to manage, monitor, and audit these alerts.

It‚Äôs essentially a system that can **create and manage ‚Äútickets‚Äù**, which can represent:

- Alerts
- Customer complaints
- Troubleshooting requests
- Or any other actionable task

## üß† Objective

The main goal of a ticketing system is to **keep track of the task at hand** and provide:

- An **audit trail**

> **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**

In this context, **Accounting** refers to **auditing and tracking actions** within your SOC environment.
