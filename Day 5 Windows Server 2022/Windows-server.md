# ðŸ§  **Day 5: Setting Up Windows Server (Target Machine)**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Deploy and configure a **Windows Server 2022** instance on **Vultr Cloud** that will act as the **target machine** for your SOC (Security Operations Center) lab.  
By the end of this setup, youâ€™ll have a **Windows Server** with **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** exposed to the internet â€” ready to generate real-world security logs.

## ðŸ§© **Steps Followed**

### **1. Log in to Vultr**
- Navigate to [Vultr Cloud Console](https://www.vultr.com/).
- Log in with your account credentials.
- Click **Deploy** â†’ **Deploy New Server**.

---

### **2. Configure Server Settings**

#### **a. Server Type**
- Select: **Cloud Compute (Shared CPU)**  
  *(Lightweight and cost-effective â€” perfect for this lab.)*

#### **b. Server Location**
- Choose the same region as your other SOC machines (e.g., **Toronto**).

#### **c. Operating System Image**
- Select: **Windows Standard**
- Version: **Windows Server 2022 (Latest)**

#### **d. Server Size**
- Choose the cheapest plan:  
  `1 vCPU / 2 GB Memory â€” $24/month`

#### **e. Additional Options**
- Disable **Auto Backups**
- Disable **IPv6**
- **Do NOT** attach this server to your existing VPC

### **3. Network Isolation Design**

To protect the rest of your SOC environment:
- Keep **ElasticSearch**, **Kibana**, **Fleet Server**, and **OS Ticket** within a **private VPC**.
- Deploy the **Windows Server** and **Ubuntu Server** **outside** of the VPC.  
  This ensures that if one of them is compromised, it wonâ€™t affect the rest of your network.
